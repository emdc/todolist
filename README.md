## Some comments

* view/components — a siple component that can be used everywhere.
* view/compositions — classes that set the composition of elements to be placed on the page; there is no logic in these components.
* view/templates — components that display holistic business information without business-logic (just forwarding cbs).
* view/widgets — components with business-logic.
